dlf contains:
	scenes (just a string of a file like x.scn)
	interactive objects 
	potentially level mesh lighting in older versions
	potentially level light sources that were used to compute level mesh lighting, some are dynamic like torches
	fogs, an area that spawns fog particles
	"nodes" that have no documentation about their data structure, and are thus unused
	paths, dunno what they are used for

fts contains:
	sceneheader, info about the size of the grid, how many textures polys etc
	textures
	cells
		polys
			positions, several normals, uvs, type flags, transparency etc
		anchors
			position etc, neighbours
	portals
		room 1 and 2, polygon forming its shape
	rooms
		num of portals and polys
		indices of portals connected to this room (data duplication)
		a weird thing called polygon, but it doesnt have enough data to form one
	room dist data, precalculated distances between rooms

llf contains:
	lights similar to dlf
	level mesh lighting

goal: changing fts polys, adding or removing them

things modified by that:
	potentially dlf lighting, but its all in llf anyway
	texture list (should form this from cells instead of a loaded database to prevent adding unneeded textures)
	cell polys (determining what poly belongs to which cell has to be done on save, dont need to edit mesh in cell based mode)
	rooms polys probably (have to find out what its data actually means)

notes:
	editing mesh should be one big mesh per material for selecting polygon to edit. (have to figure out what polygon has been clicked)
	every such submesh needs to maintain a list of polygon properties and a way to associate it with its polygon
	Maybe:(for ease of removing and adding polygons should always be quads, just that the last vertex gets the same data as the previous one to hide it?)
	the polygon that is being edited should be removed from its mesh upon selection, and added to the right mesh upon deselection

saving:
	polygons will be put into one big list, then seperated into cells
	from this lighting data will be extracted and written to llf
	then cell polys will be written to fts, and simultaneously the textures
	might have to change stuff in rooms too, depending on what its data actually means
